# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # It is recommended to only support Python 3 for new plugins, in which case this should be ">=3,<4"
  # 
  # Plugins that wish to support both Python 2 and 3 should set it to ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only support Python 2 will not be accepted into the plugin repository.

  python: ">=3,<4"
